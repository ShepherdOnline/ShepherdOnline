### SHS Thanks Maynard Nartker family for Donations to Wood Shop program

Shepherd Public Schools would like to express the appreciation to the Maynard Nartker family for donating their generous donation to the Wood Shop program. The gift will allow us to purchase some new equipment and/or allow the school to sponsor a student with additional funds for an elaborate project. The generous gift is greatly appreciated.
