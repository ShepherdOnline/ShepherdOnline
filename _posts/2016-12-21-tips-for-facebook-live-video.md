Like many other things that have been unleashed onto the Internet in the past, Facebook Live Video is a feature that is good when used well, and bad when it’s not. I’ve seen it used in several different ways, and have also been experimenting with it for a little bit.

Here are some of my thoughts about some of the things to consider when you’re planning on live streaming an event on Facebook.
<h2>Consider the scope of your video</h2>
In other words, you should try to understand the event that you’re planning on covering, and decide for yourself where and when your live stream will end. This will help to keep your live feed relevant to your audience, and return hold your audience’s attention.

Last month when I covered the Christmas Parade which went through Shepherd, I knew going in that I would want to find a spot where I could stand and record the parade from start to finish. I started recording a few minutes early so that I could catch the first floats as they approached my position, and lingered so that I captured a little bit of the tail end of the parade.
<h2>Choose the orientation of your video before you start to live stream</h2>
I’ve learned the hard way that the way that Facebook locks you into a specific orientation after you hit the start button for your video live stream. So, once you’re broadasting video you need to remember to keep your device in the same orientation throughout your broadcast. With some forethought, you can adjust the way that you’re holding your device before you go live so that you can be sure that you will get the orientation that you want for the video.

Of course, there are pros and cons for each orientation. I find that the vertical orientation is better when you’re planning on focussing on a single person, perhaps during a performance or a speech. The horizontal orientation is better when you are focussing on a crowd.
<h2>Decide if you are going to commentate</h2>
Some videos are self-explanatory or can be described in the comments on Facebook, but sometimes you might broadcast an event which needs to be explained along the way. Because of this, you may want to plan on jumping in with commentary every once in a while, or you could fill a lull in the action by summarizing what your feed has shown so far. But, it is also important not to distract your audience from what’s happening on the screen.
<h2>Respond to comments in your stream</h2>
As you’re live streaming your video it is possible for your audience to post a comment or share a “like” as they’re watching. You should plan on responding verbally to their comments when you can. Again, you might acknowledge their comment or question and then respond when there is a pause in the action on the screen. Remember, too, that there tends to be a lag between when you respond to the comment, and when the person you’re talking to will hear your response, so be patient.
