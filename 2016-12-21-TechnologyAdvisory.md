# Students learn about coding, graphic, and game design as a part of computer advisory class at Shepherd Middle School

Students at Shepherd Middle School are taking part in an advisory experience that allows them to explore various computer coding, video game, and graphic design tools. Students have a list of websites from which to choose, and they use these to decide on projects that will allow them to learn about, discover or create something new each day!

Spencer Dyer is a student in this advisory who has selected an advanced coding website called EarSketch.

According to Spencer, "I can use this website to make music with code. They have video lessons in it to teach you how to do it. It is challenging at first, but they have sample scripts that you can use use. You can build off of that."

What started out as Spencer's individual exploration in advisory then grew into a collaborative project with his classmates Alivia Schafer and Camden Winters. Spencer shared some of his music with these students to see if they liked it, and they had a great idea for it.These three students are now working together to design their own video game!

Alivia is using her advisory time, along with time at home, to learn the Python programming language. "I will do some of the coding," Alivia said, “but Camden will do most of it.”

Alivia is also using her advisory time to develop characters to be used in the game. The website she is using is called Piskel, and it allows her to create pixel art. According to Alivia, "[The game] will probably start off pretty small, but it will get bigger as we learn."

Their advisory teacher Kristi Bush is extremely excited about the direction that their project is taking. "These students are far surpassing anything I could teach them, so I simply work as a resource when I can. I provided some links to get them started. They used these as a launch pad for some amazing projects that will no doubt contribute to future career success as well."

The students seem to agree "I use these things to make a game," said Alivia, “and then I will probably become a computer programmer in the future.”
