The Shepherd Journal is currently tracking the installation of the new "Play Zone" playground located between the Shepherd walking trail and the baseball diamonds. The playground was paid for through donations from throughout the community, and it is currently being assembled by volunteers. Setup of the playground equipment will be completed today. The playground will be ready to open in the spring in time for the start of softball season.

The intention was to provide an area for younger siblings of baseball players to play on during games. It will also be opened to the community, and is located conveniently close to the start of the walking trail.
