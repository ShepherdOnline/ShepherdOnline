<blockquote>Here are a few pictures of our 8th grade girls during their field trip to MMCC recently. The girls were treated to a wonderful luncheon, heard a great speaker and participated in activities all encouraging them to try hard and to consider careers in science, technology, engineering, math and the medical field.</blockquote>
