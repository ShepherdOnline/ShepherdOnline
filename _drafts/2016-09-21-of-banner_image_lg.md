Ross Connelly wants to get out of the newspaper business, so he started a contest to help him select a new owner. Entry required a fee of $175 and an essay. The deadline was in August, but after getting too few submissions he has extended the deadline until September.

The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/us/want-to-own-a-newspaper-a-vermont-contest-has-trouble-finding-takers.html">article </a> on the *New York Times *website goes on to describe how the Gazette  has benefitted its community, and how changes in the Journalism industry has hurt it.

"Maybe the people who have experience know that you're not going to get rich and you’re going to work your butt off," he is quoted as saying. Also, speaking about younger readers, “There’s a generation and a half now of people who don’t even know what a newspaper is.”

I'm not sure that the last statement is entirely true. Younger adults may not read the newspaper, but they recognize what it is, much like they might know what a record is, or recognize a VHS tape. I’m in my 40’s, and I almost hate to admit that I will go months at at a time without touching a newspaper. The only time I look at the ad circulars in newspapers is possibly the day before Black Friday in November.

What newspapers have been experiencing is a shift in reading habits. People are consuming the news differently, and the industry has been working hard to keep up with these trends. The challenge is that nobody knows where all of these changes in technology and consumers' media habits will lead, or what media will look like when it takes its final form. Will we consume news via the Internet only? Will there only be one, gigantic Facebook page to draw our news from? Will media outlets beam news and information directly into our brains?

The most concerning part of this story for me, however, is the vacuum that would be created if this newspaper closes down.

<blockquote>
  Journalism at The Gazette consists of keeping track of local government and the goings on here and in a few surrounding towns: With milk prices falling, for example, dairy farmers are banding together to increase their clout.
</blockquote>

When I think about the newspapers that are closing down--including <em>The Shepherd Argus</em>, our own newspaper which closed down after the fire--I can't help but think about the scene in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," where Han Solo is telling Rey and Finn about the Jedi. He tells them that the Force is real, and the stories they’ve heard about the Jedi are all true.

I can't help but wonder if we are witnessing the extinction of an important breed of professional--the journalist. It is easy to take the newspapers and the reporters who work for them for granted, but in reality they form the backbone of society. The news media keeps government and corporations in check in a way that nobody else really can. Newspapers seem to have been replaced with blogs, but they aren’t quite the same.

If we're not careful, one day those of us who <em>do</em> remember back when newspapers still existed will find ourselves sounding like Han Solo. "It’s all true: Journalists did exist. They covered council meetings, investigated government corruption, and wrote editorials. We even had a phone number where you could call and say whatever you wanted, and they would print it in something called 'Sound off.’"

I think the biggest lesson we can learn from the story is that the *profession of journalism *is endangered by these trends. Connelly said that in this day and age, the people who are most qualified to take his place know that there is no money in it. That means that if Connelly retires without having found a successor there will be one less newspaper editor position in Vermont.

Traditionalists would say that if people want newspapers to stick around that they should show their support by buying more copies, but that is only a temporary solution. I think as consumers we need to look beyond the format of the news we receive, decide which kinds of stories are most important to us, and then support the news reporters and editors who bring them to us.

How do you usually get your news? Via Facebook and the Internet, or print? How do you feel that our news will be delivered as newspapers and other organizations evolve?
