# Shepherd Police Department

## Snow Safety Reminder


> If you have been outside or looked out of a window...you know it's snowing. It's not enough to need a snowblower or make a snowman...but it is enough to remind yourself to slow down on the roads. Every year we need a little refresher on driving in snow. We want everyone to get to and from their destination safely.
A great thing to remember to keep you safe on the roads...always expect the other drivers to do the wrong thing! That is defensive driving which is safe driving.

## Runaway Pig

> A little humor on this Tuesday afternoon...Officer Janofski and Isabella County Animal Control were able to wrangle a rogue potbellied pig that was wreaking havoc on Hall Street. If the pig belongs to you, it is currently at the Isabella County Animal Shelter.

## Halloween Events

There are a few Halloween events coming up in the Village that I wanted to make you aware of....
#### Haunted Forest at Salt River Park:
- 10/27 is Family Friendly Night from 6-8PM
- Cost is $1 per person or $5 for a family
- 10/28 and 10/29 is from 7-10PM and not recommended for anyone under the age of 13 years old. The cost is $3 per person and $10 for groups of 5 or less.
- The group putting on the event donates $.50 of every admission to a local charity.
#### Shepherd Elementary Parade:
- 10/31 starting at 1:30PM. The parade will leave the school, down 4th Street, down Wright Avenue to 2nd Street, down 2nd Street to Maple Street, down Maple Street to 4th Street and back to the school. Our Department, Shepherd DPW and Fire Department will be shutting down the streets. We encourage everyone to come out and see all of our young Blue Jay's and their costumes.
#### Trunk or Treat
- 10/31 from 5:30-7:30PM on Wright Avenue between 2nd and 3rd Street. This is a great event! If you don't have children, but would like to bring candy to hand out call Gina Gross at 989-828-4936 to register.
- We would love for every resident to participate in Trunk or Treat, but some still like traditional trick or treating at their door (and there is nothing wrong with preferring that). If you would like trick or treaters to come to your door, please have your porch light on.
