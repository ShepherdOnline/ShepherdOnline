<em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811?hc_ref=NEWSFEED&fref=nf">Jay Gross</a> shared an update posted by Meghan Schutt's mother, Stacy.</em>

<blockquote>Update - Meghan is out of surgery and resting comfortably. She has a metal plate holding her jaw together which will be wired shut for a minimum of 4 weeks. She is missing 5 teeth which will have to be dealt with later with some grafting and implants. Her skull fractures are going to be left to heal on their own. We will just need to watch for some things. She will need PT, OT, and Speech therapies. It will be a long road, but God is good and has watched over her and the girls! Thank you for all of your prayers and support!</blockquote>
