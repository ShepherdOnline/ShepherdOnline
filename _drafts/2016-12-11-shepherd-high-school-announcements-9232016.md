<em>Announcements for Friday, September 23rd from the <a href="">Shepherd High School</a>:</em>

<ul>
    <li>Save the Fruit!! When you get fresh fruit with your cafeteria lunch, our first choice is that you actually eat the fruit! It is nutrition that your body needs. If you aren't hungry for your fruit at lunch time and want to save it for later, that would be a great choice as well. However, if you are a "fruit dumper" and your fresh fruit ends up in the trash, we are asking that you join the "Save the Fruit" campaign instead. Please place your uneaten fresh fruit in the colorful bowls near the trash cans in the lunch room. The fruit will be rewashed and made available for students later in the day. Remember - look for the colorful bowls and Save the Fruit!!</li>
    <li>POWDER PUFF! Powder Puff participants and spectators, get ready! The game is Sunday, October 2nd at the Shepherd High school football stadium and admission is $3.
