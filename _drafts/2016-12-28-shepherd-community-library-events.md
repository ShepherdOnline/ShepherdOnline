The following ongoing programs take place inside the Shepherd Community Library Every Wednesday (unless otherwise noted):

<strong>Tales &amp; Tunes</strong>
10:00 AM - 10:30 AM

For children up to 5 years old.

Tales &amp; Tunes is a developmentally appropriate, rich language and musical environment where all children can develop a disposition toward becoming life-long readers while developing an appreciation for music! Parents, caregivers and children will interact with and respond to the best in children’s literature through musical play. Through engaged, adult participation, our goal is to immerse children in a rich environment filled with the joy of story, music and movement.

<strong>Create, Make &amp; Take Crafts</strong>
2/1/2017

3:30 PM - 4:30 PM

Join us for Create, Make and Take Crafts. Shepherd Community Library invites children of all ages to come to the library to make crafts. The library will provide all the materials and directions to create your crafts. You only need to bring your creativity.
