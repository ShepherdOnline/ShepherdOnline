This message is from Claire Bunker, Superintendent of Shepherd Public Schools.</em></p><div id="school-canceling-and-delay-procedures---shepherd-public-schools" class="section level2"><h2>School Canceling and Delay Procedures - Shepherd Public Schools</h2><p>Below are the procedures followed for school cancellations and delays:</p><ul><li><p>Transportation Director, is up at 4:00 am to check the weather and possible issues for the day.</p></li><li><p>If there is a possibility we need to cancel or delay, the process begins with people checking roads around the district.</p></li><li><p>Transportation Director talks to other transportation directors, road commission, and law enforcement.</p></li><li><p>Superintendent talks to other area Superintendents.</p></li><li><p>Decision is based on current conditions and predicted conditions.</p></li><li><p>Conditions include snowfall amounts, visibility (fog or blowing snow), drifted roads, icy roads, and temperature*.</p></li></ul><p>*If the actual temperature or wind chill is below -25 we cancel. We consider canceling at -20 depending on the forecast.</p><p>Temperature is taken into consideration because of frostbite potential of students waiting for buses and walking to school.<br/>Student safety is always first and foremost in my mind. It is one of the toughest decisions to make as a superintendent.<br/>Thank you,<br/>Claire Bunker<br/>Superintendent</p></div></div>
