<em>From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shepherdmihs/?fref=nf">Shepherd High School</a>:</em>
<blockquote>Sophomores students, it's time to order your class ring!

Herff Jones will be here on Monday, September 26th to provide you with information for ordering your class ring. A<a href="http://www.shepherdhistory.org/event/class-ring-informational-meeting/"> meeting</a> for students will be in the auditorium, at 11:35 AM. Students will be given information/order packets to help them make their selection, and are encouraged to bring them home. Information on how to order and payment options will be found in this packet and on their website <a href="http://www.highschool.herffjones.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.highschool.herff<span class="text_exposed_show">jones.com.</span></a>

Mr. Fox, Herff Jones representative, will return on October 5th during the lunch, 11:55- AM-12:30PM so that you may place your order. They will return immediately after school, 3:00 PM and remain until 5:00 PM. If a parent would like to order their student's ring, you are welcome to attend either time.

Please share this status so we may reach all Sophomores and their parents.</blockquote>
